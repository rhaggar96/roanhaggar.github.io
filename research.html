    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My research involves using cosmological simulations to probe the evolution of galaxies, groups and clusters. Some areas I am particularly focused on include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Infalling galaxies and galaxy groups</li>
    <li>Galaxy cluster outskirts ('infall regions')</li>
    <li>The effects of environment on galaxy properties</li>
    <li>Connections between simulations and observations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am involved in The Three Hundred project, an international collaboration using hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters. Through this collaboration I have contributed to several papers, as well as giving talks on my research and hosting a session at our most recent collaboration meeting.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:2.5em">Backsplash galaxies</h3>
    <div style="float:right; width:330px; font-size:70%; text-align:right"><img src="images/backsplash_path.png" width="300px" height="300px" style="margin-top:-5.5em; margin-left:30px">
<p style="margin-top:-10px; margin-right:0.5em; margin-left:30px">Paths of an infalling galaxy, cluster member and backsplash galaxy, taken from our simulations. Black circle shows the radius of the cluster, and crosses show galaxy positions at <i>z</i> = 0.</p>
</div>

    <p>'Backsplash galaxies' are a class of cluster galaxies that have previously passed through a cluster (commonly defined as passing within <i>R</i><sub>200</sub> of the cluster centre), but are now located beyond the radius of the cluster in its 'infall regions'.</p>

    <p>Because these galaxies are found in the infall regions, they are observationally hard to distinguish from galaxies on their first infall. However, passing through a cluster environment strongly affects the properties of a galaxy, and so backsplash galaxies act as a contaminant when looking at samples of infalling galaxies around clusters.</p>

    <p>Unlike observations, simulations allow us to probe the full history of astronomical objects. Backsplash galaxies can hence be identified in simulations, and so we can determine the prevalence of such galaxies. In <a class="hlink" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.6074H/abstract" target="_blank">Haggar et al. (2020)</a>, we show that the fraction of backsplash galaxies around a cluster varies between approximately 20% and 80%, and is dependent on observable bulk properties of the cluster. For example, more dynamically relaxed clusters have a greater backsplash fraction.</p>

    <div style="float:right; width:345px; font-size:70%; text-align:right"><img src="images/backsplash_ds.png" width="315px" height="225px" style="margin-top:-1.5em; margin-left:30px">
<p style="margin-top:3px; margin-right:0.5em; margin-left:30px">More relaxed clusters (greater <i>&chi;</i><sub>DS</sub>) have a greater backsplash fraction in their outskirts.</p>
</div>

    <p>This shows that a measurable property of a cluster can be used to predict what fraction of galaxies in its outskirts are truly infalling galaxies. Accounting for this in large surveys will allow the effects of galaxy pre-processing to be disentangled from effects of the cluster, and help us further understand the complex relationship between the properties and environment of a galaxy.</p>

    <p>To build on this work, we will look at more detailed relationships between backsplash galaxies and cluster properties -- for example, how the presence of large-scale structure such as filaments (as described in <a class="hlink" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.5473K/abstract" target="_blank">Kuchner et al. (2020)</a>) affects backsplash galaxies.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:2.5em">Infalling groups</h3>
    <p>Cosmic structure grows heirarchically, with smaller objects merging together to form larger objects. One consequence of this is the accretion of galaxy groups (containing ~10 galaxies) by clusters (~1000 galaxies). Again, simulations provide a useful means of testing this process, which otherwise takes ~1Gyr to occur.</p>

    <p>However, in Haggar et al. (in prep.) we find that the properties of simulated galaxy groups are dependent on the type of simulation, and specifically whether a dark matter-only or hydrodynamical simulation is being used. The distribution of galaxies in groups, and particularly in the centres of galaxy groups, differs between the simulations. We also show a similar effect in galaxy clusters.</p>

   <p>I am now interested in studying how these groups evolve in hydrodynamical simulations. Current questions we are trying to answer include whether the properties of a group affect the fate of its galaxies, how the dynamics of a group before/during its cluster infall affect its evolution, and whether any biases exist in terms of the types of group that survive infall and/or lead to the formation of backsplash galaxies.</p>
